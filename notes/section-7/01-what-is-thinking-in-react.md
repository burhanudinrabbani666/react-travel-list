To be a professional in React we have to understand how the React API works and think in React.

### Thinking In React

2. Build a Static version in React (without state)
3. Think about State :
   - 👉 When to use state
   - 👉 Type of state: Local vs Global
   - 👉 Where to place each piece of state
4. Establish data flow:
